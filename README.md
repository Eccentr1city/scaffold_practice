# Project CLI

This project integrates a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the GPT-4 Turbo model to execute bash commands through a subprocess. Users can input text, which is processed by the GPT-4 model to potentially generate bash commands. The AI model's responses may include embedded bash commands that are conditionally executed based on user approval within a controlled shell environment. This setup is carefully designed for controlled demonstration purposes.

## Features

- Processing of user input via GPT-4 Turbo model to generate responses potentially containing executable bash commands.
- Execution of bash commands directly from model responses, with user confirmation for each command.
- Real-time interaction through a command line interface.

## Usage

1. **Starting the CLI**: Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python bash_agent.py
   ```

2. **Quitting the Program**: To exit the CLI, type 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' and press enter.

3. **Changing Execution Timeout**: To change the timeout duration for command execution, enter:
   ```
   set_timeout <seconds>
   ```

4. **Executing Commands**: After processing your input, any detected bash command will be presented. Press enter to execute the command or type anything else and press enter to skip the execution.

Ensure you monitor and control the execution of commands to prevent unintended consequences.

## Safety Warning

Always review commands before execution. The system provides mechanisms for arbitrary command execution, which can be hazardous if misused. Safety measures like command validation by the user prior to execution are implemented to enhance security.
